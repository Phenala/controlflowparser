Python Control Flow Parser
------------------------------------

The control flow parser shows all possible paths of a python script. Currently it only computes control flow over if, elif and else statements.

Usage
---------

Open the <b>test.py</b> file, set the Parser object's parameter to the path of the file, and run. There are two scripts provided for testing the program, <b>dummyScript.py</b> and <b>dummyScript2.py</b> file. Otherwise, provide a procedural program that is continuous from top to bottom and has no function references.
